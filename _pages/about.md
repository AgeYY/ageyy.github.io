I am a PhD student in the Department of Physics at WashU, working on computational neuroscience under the supervision of <a href="https://physics.wustl.edu/people/ralf-wessel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Ralf Wessel</a> (2021–present). Prior to joining WashU, during the pandemic, I was fortunate to spend a year working with <a href="https://physics.hkbu.edu.hk/people/zhou-chang-song" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Changsong Zhou</a> at Hong Kong Baptist University (2020–2021), where I first became interested in neuroscience. Before that, I received my undergraduate training in physics at Sichuan University (2016–2020).

My current research interests lie in NeuroAI, particularly: (1) Modeling brain computation using deep neural networks; (2) Understanding biological and artificial neural population representations through the lens of statistics and geometry.
